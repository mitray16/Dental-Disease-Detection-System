                  <strong>Calculus</strong>, also known as tartar, refers to the hardened buildup of plaque on teeth caused by mineral deposits. It forms when plaque, a sticky film of bacteria, combines with minerals from saliva and hardens over time. If left untreated, calculus can lead to gum disease and other oral health issues.

                  <strong>Oral cancer</strong>, a subtype of head and neck cancer, manifests as malignant growths in the oral cavity, including the lips, tongue, cheeks, and throat. It often begins as a painless sore or lesion that doesn't heal, accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, persistent hoarseness, or changes in the mouth's appearance. Early detection through regular dental check-ups is crucial for successful treatment and improved prognosis.

                  <strong>Caries</strong>, commonly known as tooth decay or cavities, is a prevalent dental condition characterized by the demineralization of tooth enamel due to bacterial activity. It occurs when plaque, a sticky film of bacteria, combines with sugars from food to produce acid, which erodes tooth enamel over time. Without proper treatment, caries can progress, leading to pain, infection, and eventual tooth loss.

                    <strong>Gingivitis</strong> is a common and mild form of gum disease characterized by inflammation of the gums. It occurs due to the buildup of plaque, a sticky film of bacteria, along the gumline. Without proper oral hygiene and treatment, gingivitis can progress to more severe forms of gum disease, leading to potential tooth loss.

                <strong>Tooth discoloration</strong> refers to changes in the color of teeth, often resulting in stains or darkening of the enamel. It can occur due to various factors, including consuming certain foods and drinks, smoking, aging, or dental conditions. Treatment options for tooth discoloration range from professional teeth whitening procedures to lifestyle changes and improved oral hygiene practices.

                    <li>Uneven color distribution across the tooth surface</li>
                    <li>Sensitivity to hot or cold foods and beverages, especially if the discoloration is accompanied by enamel erosion</li>

                    <li>Tobacco use, including smoking or chewing tobacco, which can lead to deep stains and yellowing of teeth</li>
                    <li>Aging, as the enamel naturally wears down over time, revealing the darker dentin layer beneath</li>

                <strong>Plaque</strong> refers to a sticky film of bacteria that forms on teeth and along the gumline. It is a primary cause of tooth decay and gum disease, as the bacteria in plaque produce acids that erode tooth enamel and irritate the gums. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental cleanings are essential for removing plaque and maintaining optimal oral health.

                <strong>Hypodontia</strong> is a developmental condition characterized by the absence of one or more permanent teeth. It can affect any teeth in the mouth but commonly involves the wisdom teeth, second premolars, and upper lateral incisors. Treatment options for hypodontia may include orthodontic intervention, dental implants, or prosthetic devices to restore function and aesthetics.

                  <strong>Symptoms</strong><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Gaps or spaces between teeth due to missing permanent teeth</li>
                    <li>Crooked or misaligned teeth resulting from adjacent teeth shifting into the space</li>
                    <li>Difficulty chewing or biting properly, especially if multiple teeth are missing</li>

                <strong>Cavities</strong>, also known as dental caries, are decayed areas of your teeth that result from a combination of factors including bacteria, food particles, and acidic substances. They can cause toothache, sensitivity to hot and cold, and eventually lead to tooth loss if left untreated. Prevention through regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups is key to maintaining oral health and keeping cavities at bay.

                <strong>Fillings</strong> are dental restorations used to repair teeth that have been damaged by decay or trauma. They are typically made from materials such as amalgam, composite resin, or porcelain, and are designed to restore the function and appearance of the affected tooth. Fillings help to strengthen the tooth structure, prevent further decay, and alleviate discomfort caused by cavities.

                <strong>Impacted teeth</strong> occur when a tooth fails to emerge fully through the gums, often due to lack of space in the jaw or obstruction by other teeth. This commonly affects wisdom teeth but can also occur with other permanent teeth. Impacted teeth can lead to pain, swelling, infection, and misalignment of neighboring teeth, necessitating removal or other dental interventions.

                    <li>Difficulty opening the mouth or biting down due to pressure from the impacted tooth</li>

                <strong>Dental implants</strong> are artificial tooth roots made of biocompatible materials such as titanium, surgically placed into the jawbone to support replacement teeth or dental prostheses. They offer a permanent solution for replacing missing teeth, restoring both function and aesthetics to the smile. Dental implants integrate with the jawbone over time, providing stability and durability comparable to natural teeth.

                <strong>Infected tooth</strong>, also known as a dental abscess, occurs when bacteria invade the pulp, the innermost part of the tooth containing nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue. This infection can lead to severe pain, swelling, and even the formation of a pus-filled pocket at the root of the tooth. Without prompt treatment, such as root canal therapy or extraction, the infection can spread to surrounding tissues and potentially cause serious complications.
